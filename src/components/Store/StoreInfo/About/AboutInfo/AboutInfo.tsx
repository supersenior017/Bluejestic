            <p>Welcome! Please take a look around. My shop is new and just getting started. I love scalloped edged quilts
and
custom quilting. Quilting is such a beautiful form of art, you literally can wrap yourself up in it. If you 
need something
that you don't see in my listing, please contact me. Oh yeah, and one more thing Jenny is 
my golden retriever. She just
turned 8, she's usually hanging out with me while I'm working- She's the best:)</p>
